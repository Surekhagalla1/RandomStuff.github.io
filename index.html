    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Rachana Galla and Here are some websites I have created, along with a description. If you have any questions about this webpage, 
        please email rgalla2012@gmail.com.</p>
    <a href="index5.html">Lorem</a>
    <br>
    <p>Here, I have made a webpage all about the dummy text, otherwise known as Lorem Ipsum. In this page, there is information on the creator of Lorem Ipsum,
        the text itself, and some exampes.</p>
    <br>
     <a href="index6.html">window/curtainSim</a>
    <br>
    <p>In this webpage, there is a window and curtains. You can pull the curtains up and down based on the buttons. One pulls it up, one pulls it down, and the
        other stops it where it is.</p>
    <br>
    <a href = "index8.html">Percentage finder</a>
    <br>
    <p> It is annoying to calculate a student's percentage based on how many questions they got right or wrong. In this page, you can enter the amount they got right,
        and the total questions. Then, it calculates the percentage for you.</p>
    <br>
    <a href = "index9.html">Calculator</a>
    <br>
    <p> This is a digital calculator that will calulate anything for you. It works just like the real thing.</p>
